This project (case study #1 - Danny's diner)was inspired by 'Data with Danny'.

Danny’s Diner is in need of your assistance to help the restaurant stay afloat 
the restaurant has captured some very basic data from their few months of operation 
but have no idea how to use their data to help them run the business.

Danny wants to use the data to answer a few simple questions about his customers, especially about their visiting patterns, 
how much money they’ve spent and also which menu items are their favourite. 
Having this deeper connection with his customers will help him deliver a better and more personalised experience for his loyal customers.

Danny has shared with you 3 key datasets for this case study: sales, menu & members
